## Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a web-based implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors, created using JavaScript and styled with CSS where the user can play against a computer and the score is saved and tallied.

## How to Play

When playing against the computer, the user selects their move by clicking on the corresponding button for rock, paper, or scissors. The computer's move is then generated randomly.

Paper beats rock
The game keeps track of the score, displaying the number of wins, losses, and ties for each player.
